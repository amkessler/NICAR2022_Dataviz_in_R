# R reading list

Dozens of books and hundreds, perhaps thousands of articles discuss R. Here are some of our favorites. We've chosen those that we think will prove useful for journalists, particularly reporters who are just starting to use R in their work.

## General

<code>R for Data Science</code> by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund (O'Reilly, 2017), 481 pages. If you're going to buy, rent or steal just one R book, make it this one.

<code>Practical R for Mass Communications and Journalism</code> by Sharon Machlis (CRC Press, 2019), 223 pages. Written by a journalist (and longtime IRE-NICAR member) for journalists, this book takes a very practical approach - one missing from a lot of R manuals.

<code>Practical Statistics for Data Scientists</code> by Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce (O'Reilly, 2017), 284 pages. R was developed as statistical software. This book will help you deal with some of the many stats that R throws at you.

<code>R for Journalists</code> by Andrew Ba Tran. This isn't a book; it's a seven-part online course, originally sponsored by the Knight Center and posted at [learn.r-journalism.com/en/](learn.r-journalism.com/en/). Carve out time; even experienced R users will learn something here.

## Graphics and mapping

<code>R Graphics Cookbook</code> by Winston Chang (O'Reilly, 2013), 382 pages. A great introduction to R graphics, including ggplot.

<code>ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis</code> by Hadley Wickham (Springer, 2016), 253 pages. From soup to nuts, the complete guide to the most popular graphics program in the R world by the guy who invented it.

<code>An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping</code> byChris Brunsdon and Lex Comber (Sage, 2015), 333 pages. Mapping with R is just beginning to get serious attention from journalists; it has big-time capabilities as this book makes clear.

## Reference

<code>stackoverflow - advice for the R-lorn</code>If all else fails, go here. Google your error message or go to [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
and look around. More than 270,000 questions asked. So far.

<code>Rstats</code>More formally @rstatstweet. Yeah, we're getting down in the weeds here, but you can learn about new R packages (thousands and thousands every year!) and other neat stuff.

<code>Google's R Style Guide</code>In the Old Days (the 1990's), every reporter had a copy of the Associated Press Style Guide on their
desk. R nerds need a style guide too. Here it is: [https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml)

<code>The tidyverse style guide</code> Yes, there's a style guide for the tidyverse too, written of course by Hadley Wickham [https://style.tidyverse.org/_main.pdf](https://style.tidyverse.org/_main.pdf)
