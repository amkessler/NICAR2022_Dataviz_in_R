# R reading list

Dozens of books and hundreds, perhaps thousands of articles discuss R. Here are some of Ron and Meghan's favorites. We've chosen those that we think will prove useful for journalists, particularly reporters who are just starting to use R in their work.

## General

<code>R for Data Science</code> by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund. If you're going to buy, rent or steal just one R book, make it this one. Available in print (O'Reilly, 2017, 481 pages) and online [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) The online version differs in several respects from the print version.

<code>Practical R for Mass Communications and Journalism</code> by Sharon Machlis (CRC Press, 2019), 223 pages. Written by a journalist for journalists, this book by a longtime IRE-NICAR member takes a very practical approach - one missing from a lot of R manuals.

<code>Practical Statistics for Data Scientists</code> by Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce (O'Reilly, 2017), 284 pages. R was developed as statistical software. This book will help you deal with some of the many stats that R throws at you.

<code>R for Journalists</code> by Andrew Ba Tran. This isn't a book; it's a seven-part online course by the Washington Post R wizard, originally sponsored by the Knight Center and posted at [learn.r-journalism.com/en/](learn.r-journalism.com/en/). Carve out time; even experienced R users will learn something here.

<code>Text Mining with R</code> by Julia Silge and David Robinson. Excellent, easy-to-follow explanation of how to use R for n-grams, topic modeling and other text-modeling methods, available both in print (O'Reilly, 2017, 194 pages) and online [https://www.tidytextmining.com/](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

<code>Online Learning</code>R Studio has collected a set of tutorials for learning R, including data science, programming and R Markdown, at [https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/](https://www.rstudio.com/online-learning/)

<code>What They Forgot to Teach You About R</code> by Jennifer Bryan and Jim Hester. You've got to love an online course whose first chapter begins with the letters "WTF" and says it's intended for "users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle."

## Graphics and mapping

<code>R Graphics Cookbook</code> by Winston Chang (O'Reilly, 2013), 382 pages. A great introduction to R graphics, including ggplot.

<code>ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis</code> by Hadley Wickham (Springer, 2016), 253 pages. From soup to nuts, the complete guide to the most popular graphics program in the R world by the guy who invented it.

<code>An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping</code> by Chris Brunsdon and Lex Comber (Sage, 2015), 333 pages. Mapping with R is just beginning to get serious attention from journalists. It has big-time capabilities as this book makes clear.

<code>BBC Visual and Data Journalism Cookbook</code>. The BBC has posted an R package and codebook for publication-ready graphics using ggplot at [https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/)
