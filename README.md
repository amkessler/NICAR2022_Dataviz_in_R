# NICAR 2019

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Newport Beach, CA, March 7-10, 2019. Meghan Hoyer of the Associated Press and I will be teaching a 3-part introduction to R. You'll find step-by-step tutorials as well as data and a reading list.
Meghan will teach the first part, Intro to R. You'll find her handout here[].
I will teach the next two parts, Data analysis and plotting, and Gathering and cleaning data. Tip sheets and data for both are at this repo.
People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, mosaic and janitor packages. Two tutorials and a handful of data files are provided. To get the data, click on the "Branch: master" box next to the word "NICAR2019" in boldface blue letters and then click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see the CSV and Excel files.
