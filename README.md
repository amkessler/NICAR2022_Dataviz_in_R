# NICAR2022_Dataviz_in_R

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on advanced concepts in visualization at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Atlanta March 3-6, 2022. The conference will also be conducted online.

People using these materials should have the latest versions of R and R Studio, the tidyverse metapackage installed, plus the following packages, which can be installed by running this line of code in the console:

`install.packages(c("sf", "scales", "viridis", "tmap", "tigris", "tmaptools", "maps", "geosphere", "htmltools", "janitor", "rmapshaper", "here", "usethis", "kableExtra", "janitor", "igraph", "tidygraph", "ggraph", "RColorBrewer", "plotly"))`

**To load the repo for this class session, run this line from the console:**

**`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/amkessler/NICAR2022_Dataviz_in_R/archive/refs/heads/master.zip")`**

The material for this session is based on pairing my own scripts on GIS concepts and mapping, social network analysis, and plotly charting, with a script by Ron Campbell on ggplot2 charting and mapping.
