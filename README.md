# NICAR 2022

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Atlanta March 3-6, 2022. The conference will also be conducted online.

I will teach a course on data visualization with R. Tip sheets and data for both are at this repo.

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the following packages: tidyverse, sf, scales, tmap, and viridis. A handful of data and shapefiles are provided. To get the data, click on the "Branch: master" box next to the word "NICAR2022" in boldface blue letters and then click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see the CSV data files and the folders containing the shapefiles.

I will also provide instructions on how to download the data and maps directly from the Census Bureau using the tidycensus and tigris packages.
