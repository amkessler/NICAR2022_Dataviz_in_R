# NICAR2022_Dataviz_in_R

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on advanced concepts in visualization at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Atlanta March 3-6, 2022. The conference will also be conducted online.

The material for this session is based on pairing one script by Ron Campbell with another of my own, to cover the concepts of data visualization through mapping and charts with R. Tip sheets and data are included in this repo.

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the following packages: tidyverse, sf, scales, tmap, and viridis.
