# NICAR2022_Dataviz_in_R

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on advanced concepts
in visualization at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Atlanta March
3-6, 2022. The conference will also be conducted online.

The material for this session is based on pairing my own scripts on GIS
concepts and social network analysis with a script by Ron Campbell on
ggplot2, to cover the concepts of data visualization through mapping and
charts with R.

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest
versions of R and R Studio, the tidyverse metapackage installed, plus
the following packages, which can be installed by running:

`install.packages(c("sf", "scales", "viridis", "tmap", "tigris", "tmaptools", "maps", "geosphere", "htmltools", "janitor", "rmapshaper", "here", "kableExtra", "janitor", "igraph", "tidygraph", "ggraph"))`
