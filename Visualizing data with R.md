# Visualizing data with R

It's easy to get overwhelmed by numbers. Sometimes there are just so many of them that you hardly know where to start. This can be a problem for data journalists. But R is here to rescue you. In addition to its tools for slicing, dicing and crunching numbers, it has wonderful packages for charting and mapping data - no artistic talent required.

We'll be using data and maps from the 2020 Census and 2019 American Community Survey for Georgia and the Atlanta metro region. In a separate tipsheet, we describe how to import and clean that data. If you're taking this class at NICAR in Atlanta, it's pre-loaded on your laptop. If you're reading this later, the data and maps (shapefiles, each contained in a folder) are in the Data section; click on NICAR2022 at top left, then switch the tab from Master to Data.
